{"name":"lbfgs","tagline":"Efficient L-BFGS and OWL-QN Optimization in R","body":"[Download the Vignette](https://github.com/AntonioCoppola/lbfgs/blob/master/inst/doc/lbfgsVignette.pdf?raw=true)\r\n-----\r\nAuthors: [Antonio Coppola](https://github.com/AntonioCoppola) and [Brandon Stewart](http://scholar.harvard.edu/bstewart)\r\n\r\nWhile the `optim` function in the R core package `stats` provides a variety of general purpose optimization algorithms for differentiable objectives, there is no comparable general optimization routine for objectives with a non-differentiable penalty. Non-differentiable penalties such as the L1 norm are attractive because they promote sparse solutions. However it is this same lack of smoothness which makes the gradient-based methods in `optim` inapplicable. \r\n\r\nThe `lbfgs` package addresses this issue by providing access to the Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (OWL-QN) optimization algorithm of Andrew and Gao (2007) which allows for optimization of an objective with an L1 penalty. The package uses the [`libLBFGS`](http://www.chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/) C++ library by Okazaki (2010), which itself is a port of the Fortran implementation by Nocedal (1980). In addition to OWL-QN the package provides an implementation of L-BFGS which complements `optim`. The linkage between R and C++ is achieved using [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/).\r\n\r\nThe package provides general purpose access to these two optimization algorithms which are suitable for large-scale applications with high-dimensional parameters. The objective and gradient can be programmed in R or directly in C++ for high performance.\r\n\r\nInstallation and Usage\r\n-----\r\nDownload the package tarball and build using R commands, or alternatively instally directly from Github using Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package. The R command is:\r\n```\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"lbfgs\", \"AntonioCoppola\")\r\n```\r\nFor usage, please refer to the documentation and to the PDF manual.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
