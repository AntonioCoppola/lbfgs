Description: A wrapper for the libLBFGS optimization library written by Naoaki Okazaki. The L-BFGS method solves the unconstrainted minimization problem, minimize the function F(x), where x = (x1, x2, ..., xN), if the objective function F(x) and its gradient G(x) are both computable. The L-BFGS method finds a minimizer iteratively, by approximating the inverse hessian matrix by information from last m iterations. This saves the memory storage and computational time drastically for large-scaled problems. This library also implements the OWL-QN (Orthant-Wise Quasi-Newton Limited-Memory) optimization algorithm, which serves to minimize T(x) = F(x) + P(x), where P(x) is the L1-norm of the parameter vector.
